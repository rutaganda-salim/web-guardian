## üü• WebGuardian v0.1 - The Multi-Tool Web Vulnerability Scanner

### Evolution

It is quite a fuss for a pentester to perform binge-tool-scanning (running security scanning tools one after the other) sans automation. Unless you are a pro at automating stuff, it is a herculean task to perform binge-scan for each and every engagement. The ultimate goal of this program is to solve this problem through automation; viz. running multiple scanning tools to discover vulnerabilities, effectively judge false-positives, collectively correlate results and saves precious time; all these under one roof.

Enter WebGuardian.

### Features

- One-step installation.
- Executes a multitude of security scanning tools, does other custom coded checks and prints the results spontaneously.
- Some of the tools include nmap, dnsrecon, wafw00f, uniscan, sslyze, fierce, lbd, theharvester, amass, nikto etc executes under one entity.
- Saves a lot of time, indeed a lot time!
- Checks for same vulnerabilities with multiple tools to help you zero-in on false positives effectively.
- Extremely light-weight and not process intensive.
- Legends to help you understand which tests may take longer time, so you can Ctrl+C to skip if needed.
- Association with OWASP Top 10 & CWE 25 on the list of vulnerabilities discovered. (under development)
- Critical, high, medium, low and informational classification of vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability definitions guides you what the vulnerability actually is and the threat it can pose.
- Remediation tells you how to plug/fix the found vulnerability.
- Executive summary gives you an overall context of the scan performed with critical, high, low and informational issues discovered.
- Artificial intelligence to deploy tools automatically depending upon the issues found. For example, automates the launch of wpscan and plecost tools when a WordPress installation is found. (under development)
- Detailed comprehensive report in a portable document format (\*.pdf) with complete details of the scans and tools used. (under development)
- On the run metasploit auxiliary modules to discover more vulnerabilities. (under development)

### Vulnerability Checks

- ‚úîÔ∏è DNS/HTTP Load Balancers & Web Application Firewalls.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Checks for Joomla, WordPress and Drupal.
- ‚úîÔ∏è SSL related Vulnerabilities (HEARTBLEED, FREAK, POODLE, CCS Injection, LOGJAM, OCSP Stapling).
- ‚úîÔ∏è Commonly Opened Ports.
- ‚úîÔ∏è DNS Zone Transfers using multiple tools (Fierce, DNSWalk, DNSRecon, DNSEnum).
- ‚úîÔ∏è Sub-Domains Brute Forcing (DNSMap, amass, nikto).
- ‚úîÔ∏è Open Directory/File Brute Forcing.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Shallow XSS, SQLi and BSQLi Banners.
- ‚úîÔ∏è Slow-Loris DoS Attack, LFI (Local File Inclusion), RFI (Remote File Inclusion) & RCE (Remote Code Execution).
